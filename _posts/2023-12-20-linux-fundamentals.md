"Linux" is more of an umbrella term for multiple OS's that are based on UNIX which happens to be open source thus enabling variants of Linux to come in all shapes and sizes best suited for the system they are being used for i.e as a web or application server or as a desktop.

Linux based operating systems are good for software engineering as they are lightweight, However they are not quite user friendly as often users will be required to interact with these systems using the terminal. In this article we will cover basic linux commands that will enable us do basic functions like interact with the filesystem, searching for files, understanding shell operators, permissions etc.

Below are some commands and their description:

| Command | Full Name| Description |
| --- | --- |--- |
| `echo` | echo |Output any text that we provide |
| `whoami` | who am i | Find out what user we're currently logged in as! |
| `ls` | listing | lists the contents of the current diectory |
| `cd` | change directory | changing our current directory, this command is used to open a given directory |
| `cat` | concatenate | used to output contents of a file  > You can use cat to output the contents of a file within directories without having to navigate to it by using cat and the name of the directory. I.e. cat /home/ubuntu/Documents/todo.txt|
| `pwd` | print working directory | used to find out the full path to the current working directory |
